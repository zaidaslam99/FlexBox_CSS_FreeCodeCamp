<!-- So here lets examine what is going on here the first thing that we need to know is that we created two diffferent div and in them what we did was that we passed in 5 different div each the first div is the container and the second div is the container-1 now what we did was that we styled them to their own way alot of thing that we already covered however there is something that we didnt cover and that being flex direction and that is set to coloum what this means is that something that I also wanted to point out here is that what this does is normally we will have the coloum that is set horizontally and instead what we will have now is the thing set vertically -->
