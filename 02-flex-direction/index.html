<!-- So we learned thus far when it comes to working with flexbox that we can style boxes in a way where we can have the display set as flex and if not flex then it goes to default which is going down and another thing to understand is that we are going to be working with div and they are going to be taking up parts of the containers that we built and when it comes to flex direction what we need to know is that we can reverse the order of the divs that are in the box that we created the other thing that I relaized here is this that when we do display flex we are doing it for for the outer container class and not the inner container that are within the big contianer -->
